# tc4plus-coffee-roaster-shield

The TC4+ is an Arduino shield designed for temperature measurement, logging and control applications. Both the original TC4 and the TC4+ are designed with coffee roasting applications in mind, but work for a wide range of applications. The TC4+ is an extension of the TC4 shield, adding useful extra such as DC fan motor control and a header for an optional Bluetooth module.

**Features**

- 4-channel, high-resolution thermocouple interface.

- 2-channel SSR drivers for AC loads, and single-channel DC driver for DC fan motors.

- Full compatibility with TC4-based Arduino sketches and established software ecosystem.
- Highly simplified control of popcorn machine based roasters: On-board voltage regulator and DC PWM driver allow popcorn roaster setup with just the TC4+, a single DC power supply and one solid state relay.
- Designed with a high degree of flexibility in mind. Wide range of voltage regulators supported; extra I2C headers for displays and other peripherals; retains all TC4 features and full Arduino pinout.
- Wireless control with optional Bluetooth module.
